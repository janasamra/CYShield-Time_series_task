Apply an appropriate forecasting model to predict the sales for the next 10 days for each product in each city.


In this project, we aimed to predict the sales for the next 10 days for each product across various cities, utilizing a comprehensive approach that included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation. Throughout the analysis, we identified key insights related to sales trends by city and day of the week, allowing us to understand the underlying patterns in the data. One critical insight gained during the project was the realization that the initial year of sales data may not have been of high quality, potentially affecting the model's predictive accuracy. This finding highlights the importance of evaluating the quality of historical data and its impact on model performance.

Evaluation Metrics To assess the effectiveness of our predictive model, we employed several regression evaluation metrics:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 8.59
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.89
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 73.72
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 2.04%
Mean Percentage Error (MPE): -0.0021%
R-squared (R²): 0.997
These metrics indicate that our model performed exceptionally well, with a high R² value of 0.997, suggesting that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the sales data. The low RMSE and MAE values further demonstrate the model's accuracy in forecasting sales.
